    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
    <div class="text">
        At Centre for Applied Research and People
'
s
Engagement (CARPE) and Civic Response Team(CRT), we have been working with local governments to build inclusive and sustainable 
solid waste management (SWM) systems for five years. Sustainable, because we focus on
effective use of resources and on maximising
resource recovery. Inclusive, because we focus on
dignity of labour for formal and informal waste
workers.
Across all locations where we have implemented
our BOTRAM process for SWM systems
transformation, we have witnessed the invaluable
contribution of formal and informal waste workers
in making our cities liveable. This has been
highlighted during the global COVID-19
outbreak. Across cities waste workers continue to
expose themselves to the solid waste from
hundreds of households even as everyone else
focuses on minimising exposure.
As we started to discuss the health and safety of
our teams and our organisation with respect to
COVID-19, we soon faced the question - “
what
can our sanitation teams and waste pickers, our
on-field partners, expect from us?” From first
securing immediate relief and protective
equipment for those that work directly with us, we
have expanded our efforts to reach others in the
SWM sector and beyond through the CORONA
RELIEF INITIATIVE.
